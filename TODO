# Deterministic WR
    In the linear layer, the weights should be initialized with Kaiming Normal 


# Thursday morning
Fix wide resnet model and figure out why v2 gives NANs 

Set up elbo loss function 
    DONE figure out difference between using nll_loss and cross_entropy DONE
    DONE implement L2 reg

    Look into whether the nll should really be scaled by N/B or if the "classical" 1/B is fine


# Model parameters
Implement prior mean and stddev as hyperparameters
