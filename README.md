# Rank-1-Bayesian-Neural-Networks
Code used in my bachelor project studying the use of rank-1 factorization in regard to Bayesian neural networks (BNN). 
The rank-1 BNN as well as the baseline frameworks (a deterministic Wide ResNet, Monte Carlo dropout and Deep Ensembles) have been implemented in PyTorch. 

The folder *baselines* contains the different baseline models (i.e. deterministic Wide Resnet 28-10, MC dropout and deep ensembles). 
The folder *BNN* contains all files related to the BNN implementation, such as the custom loss function, scheduler and layers (convolutional and fully connected layer).
